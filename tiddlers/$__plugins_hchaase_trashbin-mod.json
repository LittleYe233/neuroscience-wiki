The problem\n\nIf you use JD's very nice [[Plain Revisions|http://j.d.revisions.tiddlyspot.com/]] plugin and also want to use Kookma's very nice [[Trashbin|https://kookma.github.io/TW-Trashbin/]] plugin you have a problem! when a tiddler go in the trash bin, the revisions are not touched, and if you later delete the tiddler from trash, you will have revisions of non-existing tiddelrs filling up the wiki and a hard time locating these revisions.\n\n!! The solution\n\nThe solution is my Trashbin-mod. With this mod, the revision tiddlers will be deleted whenever the corresponding tiddeler is deleted permanently from the trash bin. \n\nThe revisions are not changed nor deleted as long as the corresponding tiddler is in the trash bin. Therefore, if you restore a tiddler from the trash bin, the revisions will still be there.\n\n!!! Features\n\n# When a tiddler is ''permanently'' deleted from the trash (individually or in bulk), the corresponding revisions of these tiddelers are also deleted. \n# In the trashbin sidebar I added a count items in trash that will appear when the trashbin is not empty. \n\n!! Install\n\n# Drag and drop the plugin to your wiki: [[$:/plugins/hchaase/trashbin-mod]]\n# Drag and drop these tiddlers to your wiki: [[$:/plugins/kookma/trashbin/macros/bulk-operation]] and [[$:/plugins/kookma/trashbin/ui/sidebar]]\n\n!! Uninstall\n\nDelete the above tiddlers and the plugin tiddler.\n\n!! Tip\n\nIf you (like me) don't want the sidebar cluttered, you can move the trashbin to the more tab by replacing the `$:/tags/SideBar` tag with `$:/tags/MoreSideBar` tag.\n\n\n!! Issues ?\nPost them at [[github|https://github.com/hchaase/TW-Trashbin-mod/issues]].\n\n!!Changelog\n\nv2.0.0\n\n* [new] compatible with the [[trashbin plugin|https://kookma.github.io/TW-Trashbin/]] v 1.2.1\n* [new] moved the mod to a macro\n\n\nv1.1.0\n\n* made it compatible with the new [[trashbin plugin v 1.2.0|https://kookma.github.io/TW-Trashbin/]] \n\nv 1.0.0\n\n* first release.
